            <h1>The Printer Qualification Wizard</h1>
			<p>
				This tool quickly qualifies the minimum geometric feature size of an additive manufacturing process
				under a set of machine/material/build parameter/post-processing conditions. It does this by iteratively printing
				a series of test parts which evaluate the printer's ability to form thin columns and bars. After each
				print, the results of the print are used to determine the parameters for the next part to print.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Using this iterative approach, a minimum of material and print time is used. If the initial guess is
				good, usually two or three iterations are all that are required to obtain minimum values with two digits
				of precision.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Note that a certain amount of user judgement is required when evaluating a "successful" print. We
				generally suggest "success" be defined as material deposited in a <i>controlled</i>, <i>stable</i>
				manner, so as to ensure that future parts procuded at this minimum scale will turn out consistently.
			</p>
			<h2>Using the Wizard</h2>
			<h3>First Part</h3>
			<p>
				The first page of the wizard presents three methods for determining the initial test part to print. If
				you have no prior knowledge about the print process, expand the Use Defaults section to generate a
				generic test part that works well as a starting place on many processes that operate on the milimeter
				scale.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				If you have some information about the printer parameters, start with the Guided Settings section and
				enter the parameter listed in the explanatory text. A part will be generated which spans the range near
				the minimum possible element size predicted by your printer type.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				If you have strong prior process knowledge, the Use Custom Settings section allows you to specify the
				minimum and maximum pillar and bar diameters to use explicitly.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Regardless of which route you choose, press the associated Generate Part button to have the server
				automatically create a test part for your particular scenario. After a few seconds, a dialog should
				notify you the part is ready to be downloaded. Go print the part on your printer with the associated
				process/material/post-processing settings you wish to use, and then click the Next button.
			</p>
			<h3>Successive Parts</h3>
			<p>
				After printing a test part, the wizard will ask you to identify which features were not resolved. Note
				that a printer may still produce the geometry, but it may be unstable, deformed, or unable to support
				its own weight, and therefore should not be considered "resolved".
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Use the sliders in each section to indicate how many columns and bars printed successfully. If you are
				content with the error bounds listed in the Current Results section, click Finish Wizard to accept these
				figures. If another iteration is desired, click Generate Part to "zoom in" on the dimensions nearest the
				failure point. A new part will be generated. Download it, print it, and click the Next button to
				continue.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				To alter how fast the algorithm zooms in on the failure region, use the Zoom entry boxes in the Generating
				options section. The higher the number, the smaller the difference will be between the minimum and
				maximum feature size of the next part. If this number is too low, it will take many iterations to reach
				an acceptable tolerance. If it is too high, the next part may be slightly too big or slightly too small
				and have all elements either resolved or unresolved.
